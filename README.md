# Komanse

A simple boilerplate for building Micro SaaS Businesses with Ruby on Rails!

## ðŸ‘‰ Get Started

### Requirements

You'll need the following installed to run the template successfully:

* Ruby 3.0 or higher
* bundler - `gem install bundler`
* Redis - For ActionCable support (and Sidekiq, caching, etc)
* PostgreSQL - `brew install postgresql`
* Yarn - `brew install yarn` or [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) for Stripe webhooks in development - `brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe`

All Homebrew dependencies are listed in `Brewfile`, so you can install them all at once like this:

```bash
brew bundle install --no-upgrade
```

Then you can start the database servers:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
brew services start redis
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
bin/bundle install
```

```bash
bin/bundle install
```

Run the development server

```bash
bin/dev
```

### Updating Credentials

```bash
EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit --environment=production
```

## Merging Updates

First we need to add a remote for the Komanse repository

```bash
git remote add komanse https://github.com/febyen/komanse.git
```

To merge updates, use git merge from the jumpstart origin.

```bash
git fetch komanse
git merge komanse/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Keep in mind, the more customization you do, the harder merges will be. Instead of merging from Komanse, you might want to cherry pick commits or manually apply changes to you repository.
